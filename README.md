# Movie-Recommender
In this repository, the goal is to build a recommender system that will predict user ratings for films and the datasets are from Netflix Prize data.

In this topk-database branch, the Item-based Collabrative Filtering Algorithm is implemented with MapReduce.

The recommended movies were sorted and worte into database.
